## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried grid layout for this project - and found it really usefully for the desktop view, where the different sections spanned different areas of the layout.

### Continued development

I have only scratched the surface of what grid layouts can be used for so will be looking more into this.

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I got a lot of inspiration from Grace Snow's solution to this project - particularly the use of blockquote elements for the individual testimonials and a hidden heading for accessibility.
